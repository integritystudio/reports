# Code Condensation Whitepaper

A research collection on data compression strategies for code, telemetry, and storage — covering algorithms, pipelines, and practical tooling for the 2025–2026 ecosystem.

## Research Papers

### [Repomix-to-Condense Pipeline: Compression Analysis & Tool Integrations](repomix_to_condense_with_additional_integrations.md)
The core document. Answers how much repomix losslessly condenses a codebase, what a `code → repomix → zstd` pipeline adds, and whether the round-trip is recoverable. Includes a deep dive on integrations with PPM, ast-grep, and custom Makefiles for polyglot repos with mixed file types — with per-type compression strategy tables and concrete pipeline examples.

### [OTEL Telemetry Data Compression](otel_telemetry_data_compression.md)
Compression best practices for OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and logs. Covers OTLP protocol compression options (gzip mandatory, zstd/snappy optional), OTel Arrow's 30–70% bandwidth reduction, ClickHouse codec selection for SigNoz/ClickStack, collector pipeline configuration, and dictionary training on protobuf samples. Includes cost impact estimates for SaaS ingest at scale.

### [SQL & KV Data Storage Compression](sql_kv_data_compression.md)
Compression best practices for relational databases and key-value stores. Covers PostgreSQL TOAST (pglz vs lz4), ClickHouse per-column codec selection (Delta, DoubleDelta, Gorilla, T64, ZSTD), RocksDB compression by level, Redis memory encoding (ziplist/listpack), and Cloudflare KV edge compression. Addresses write amplification tradeoffs across compression levels.
