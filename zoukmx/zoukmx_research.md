## Executive Summary

ZoukMX is a premier Brazilian Zouk dance festival and immersive training program held annually in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, now in its 11th year of operation. Organized by Joe Sandoval, the event has evolved from a weekend festival into a month-long experience combining a 100-hour intensive training program (across 7 specialized tracks), pre-festival workshops, a multi-day festival with BZDC-sanctioned Jack & Jill competitions, and unique excursion parties at cenotes and jungle lagoons. The event draws attendees from 25+ countries and features 14+ internationally renowned Brazilian Zouk artists and DJs. ZoukMX operates within the rapidly growing global music festival market (valued at $3.76B in 2025, CAGR 23.17%) and music tourism sector ($96.78B in 2024, CAGR 18.8%), while benefiting from Quintana Roo's position as Mexico's top tourism destination with 24.4M visitors in 2025. With 8,600+ Instagram followers and a strong reputation in the global Zouk community, ZoukMX is well-positioned as the only 100-hour Brazilian Zouk intensive in North America, though opportunities exist to expand digital presence, formalize business registration, and increase capacity to capture the growing demand for experiential dance travel.

## 11. Conclusions & Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Market leader in niche:** ZoukMX is the only 100-hour Brazilian Zouk intensive in North America and one of only two month-long Zouk experiences globally (alongside Zouk Island in Thailand).
2. **Strong tailwinds:** Benefits from three high-growth macro trends: music tourism (18.8% CAGR), experiential travel, and wellness retreats ($222.5B market).
3. **Location advantage:** Playa del Carmen within Quintana Roo (Mexico's #1 tourism state at 46.4% of foreign tourism revenue) provides strong infrastructure and natural appeal.
4. **Brand maturity:** 11 years of operation, 8,600+ Instagram followers, presence on 5+ dance directories, press coverage, and BZDC affiliation establish credibility.
5. **Expansion opportunities:** Online presence gaps (no Google Business, TripAdvisor, YouTube, or transparent pricing) limit discoverability outside the existing Zouk community.

### Recommendations for Further Research

- Obtain specific ticket pricing data (requires Eventbrite purchase flow or direct inquiry)
- Survey past attendees for satisfaction data, demographics, and spending patterns
- Research business entity registration under alternative names
- Analyze Instagram engagement rate relative to follower count
- Investigate corporate retreat / B2B opportunity potential
- Benchmark capacity against competitor festivals to estimate revenue range
- Explore partnership potential with Riviera Maya tourism board

### 90-Day Quick Wins

1. Create Google Business Profile for "ZoukMX" in Playa del Carmen
2. List on TripAdvisor as an "Experience" or "Tour"
3. Display pricing tiers on the website to reduce sales funnel friction
4. Launch YouTube channel with workshop highlight reels
5. Solicit and publish video testimonials from past attendees
