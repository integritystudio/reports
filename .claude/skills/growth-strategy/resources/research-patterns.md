Validated research patterns extracted from the Illumination Holiday Lighting session (2026-02-08). Use as reference for structuring agent prompts and organizing findings.

- "[industry] year-round services"

- "[industry] maintenance contracts"

### Target Community Research

Search for growing residential areas:
- "master planned communities [city] [year]"
- "new construction [city] [year]"
- "fastest growing suburbs [city]"
- "HOA communities [city]"
- "[city] new developments"

Build a table with: Community, Location, Why Target (HOA activity, home values, growth).

### Service Area Expansion

Rank surrounding cities by growth rate. Search:
- "fastest growing cities near [city]"
- "population growth [suburb] TX [year]"
- "[suburb] new home permits [year]"

## Category 2: Marketing Opportunities

### Digital Presence Audit

Check current presence on:
- Google Business Profile (search Google Maps for company name)
- Yelp (search yelp.com)
- Facebook (search facebook.com)

3. Facebook (reviews, groups, zip-code ads)

### Competitive Threat Assessment

## Agent Prompt Best Practices

From session telemetry (67 tool uses, 157K tokens, ~33 min):

1. **Be specific:** Name the company, location, zip code, years in business, known gaps
2. **Provide context:** Include owner name, service types, current online presence status
3. **Request specifics:** "For each opportunity, provide URLs, names, costs, and application details"
4. **Set expectations:** "Priority level (high/medium/low) based on potential ROI"
5. **Cover all 6 categories** in a single prompt to maximize agent efficiency
6. **Run in background:** The agent takes 25-35 minutes; use `run_in_background: true`
