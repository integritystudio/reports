## Executive Summary

Texas Realty Partners, LLC (TRP) is a boutique full-service real estate brokerage founded in 2005 by Karen G. Skelton (Princeton AB, UT MBA) and headquartered at 248 Addie Roy Rd., Suite B-302 in Austin's Westlake corridor (78746). TRP serves the Austin-San Antonio corridor with an unusually broad service mix spanning residential brokerage, commercial leasing, investment analysis, 1031 exchanges, due diligence/business valuation, development entitlements, and expert witness services. Since founding, TRP has completed $40MM+ in sales, $25MM+ in structured financing, and $20MM+ in leases. The firm operates in a $240 billion US real estate brokerage industry currently navigating post-NAR settlement commission restructuring, rising inventory levels, and rapid consolidation (Compass-Anywhere merger). The Austin MSA (pop. 2.55M, median HHI $99,897) represents a $16.9 billion annual residential market with an addressable market of approximately 549,000 owner-occupied homes. TRP's key competitive advantages are deep principal experience (75+ combined years), rare due diligence/valuation bundling, and development entitlement expertise. Critical gaps include near-zero online reviews, minimal social media presence, and no visibility on major consumer platforms.

> **Overall Online Presence Score: 1.5 / 5.0** — Significantly below average for a 20-year Austin brokerage. The principals have strong credentials and real transaction history, but this story is nearly invisible to anyone who doesn't already know TRP by name.

## 11. Conclusions & Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Legitimate, experienced firm with rare service depth.** TRP's combined due diligence + business valuation + development entitlement + brokerage offering is unique among Austin boutique firms. No competitor explicitly markets this bundle.

2. **Exceptional principal credentials** (Princeton, UT MBA, institutional banking background) are underutilized from a marketing perspective. The $40MM+ track record and complex deal history (infrastructure negotiations, zoning changes) demonstrate sophisticated capabilities.

3. **Severe online visibility deficit.** Near-zero reviews, dormant social media, no SEO traction. This is the single largest risk to future business development in an increasingly digital-first buyer/seller landscape.

4. **Favorable market position for buyer's market.** With Austin shifting to a buyer's market (4.2 months inventory, 53.4% of listings cutting prices), TRP's investment analysis and due diligence services become more valuable to buyers seeking thorough property evaluation.

5. **Industry consolidation creates opportunity.** As mega-brokerages (Compass, KW, eXp) dominate volume, boutique firms with deep expertise and personal relationships can differentiate on quality of service — but only if discoverable.

### Recommendations for Further Research

- Verify TREC license status directly via [TREC License Holder Search](https://www.trec.texas.gov/apps/license-holder-search/)
- Check Google Maps directly for current review count (blocked to automated tools)
- Request financial details from TRP principals for detailed valuation
- Interview Karen Skelton regarding La Costa Verde development timeline and status
- Verify Jamison Stewart's current sponsoring broker via TREC
- Conduct a formal website audit (PageSpeed, accessibility, crawlability) via direct browser access
