### Closest Direct Competitors

1. **Burns Anderson Jury & Brenner (18 attorneys)** — Nearly identical size; strongest practice-area overlap (insurance defense, construction, employment, appellate)
2. **Hanna & Plaut (10–13 attorneys)** — Smaller but directly competitive on insurance defense/coverage and appellate

### Strengths

- 35-year track record with 1,000+ bad faith cases and TX Supreme Court victories
- Breadth of practice: insurance + construction + employment + securities + appellate under one roof
- AV Preeminent rating and 17-year Super Lawyer streak
- Local counsel capability for national firms
- Expert witness services as differentiator

### Challenges & Opportunities

- Not currently Chambers-ranked (several smaller competitors have achieved this)

- Succession planning considerations

## 11. Conclusions & Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Established market position:** 35 years in Austin with AV Preeminent-rated managing partner
2. **Broad practice differentiation:** Insurance + securities + construction + employment + appellate under one 17-attorney roof is uncommon among Austin boutiques
3. **Massive insurance market tailwind:** TX's $293.9B premium base and $47B+ in 2024 insured losses drive demand for insurance defense
4. **Growing metro:** 2.55M-person MSA with 63,000+ establishments and $99,897 median household income
5. **Competitive gap in rankings:** Lacks Chambers USA recognition that several smaller competitors have achieved

### Recommendations for Further Research

- Manually verify TX SOS and Comptroller records
- Visit Avvo/Martindale in a browser for full rating data
- Check Google Business Profile for reviews
- Search PACER for current case volume
- Assess succession planning given co-founder's passing
