            <p>This guide compiles actionable Austin-based resources, professional certifications, association memberships, ranking submissions, and growth opportunities curated for Skelton &amp; Woody PLLC&mdash;a 35-year boutique litigation firm with 17 attorneys specializing in business litigation and insurance defense.

Items are organized by priority and category, with a recommended action timeline at the end.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <strong>Top 3 Priority Actions:</strong> (1) Submit for <strong>Chambers USA 2027</strong> rankings (research submissions open spring 2026&mdash;addresses the competitive gap identified in the research report), (2) pursue <strong>TBLS Insurance Law Board Certification</strong> for eligible attorneys (added in 2023, very few certified statewide&mdash;major differentiator), and (3) <strong>verify and optimize Google Business Profile</strong> (current status unknown, competitors have established local search presence).
