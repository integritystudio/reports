[Title]
[Company Name]
[Address]

Dear [Hiring Manager Name / Hiring Committee],

I am writing to apply for the [Position Title] at [Company Name]. As an LLM candidate in International Commercial Arbitration at Stockholm University with a background in International and European Law, I am drawn to [Company Name]'s work at the intersection of AI innovation and responsible governance. My combination of arbitration expertise, EU AI Act knowledge, and multilingual capabilities positions me to contribute meaningfully to your [legal/policy/compliance] team.

**Why AI and Law**

The legal frameworks governing AI are being written now—and I want to help shape them. My coursework on the EU AI Act revealed how profoundly AI will transform legal practice, from contract analysis to dispute resolution. This is not a distant future; the AAA-ICDR launched its first AI arbitrator in November 2025, and the ICC has established a Task Force examining AI in arbitration proceedings. I see an opportunity to bridge two fields I am passionate about: international dispute resolution and emerging technology governance.

**What I Bring**

My experience as a legal researcher for A for Arbitration developed my ability to analyze complex cross-border disputes and translate findings into practical guidance. At Clifford Chance's Antitrust Global Virtual Internship, I gained exposure to how leading firms approach regulatory compliance at scale. These experiences taught me to work at the intersection of legal analysis and business strategy—precisely the skill set required for AI governance work.

I also bring genuine multilingual capability. As a native speaker of both German and Spanish, with C2 English and working French, I can conduct primary source research across the EU's major legal systems. With the EU AI Act now in effect and member states implementing its requirements differently, this ability to access original language materials offers tangible value for compliance and policy work.

**Why [Company Name]**

[Company Name]'s commitment to [specific aspect—e.g., responsible AI development / AI safety research / helping organizations navigate AI governance] resonates with my belief that legal frameworks should enable innovation while protecting fundamental rights. I am particularly interested in [specific team, project, or initiative], where I could contribute research on [relevant topic such as: international AI regulation, AI in dispute resolution, cross-border compliance].

I am eager to bring my legal training, research capabilities, and cross-cultural perspective to [Company Name]. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

**Isabel Budenz**

# Cover Letter Variants

## Variant A: AI Company (Policy/Legal Team)

*For companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft*

**Suggested customizations:**

> I am drawn to [Company Name]'s leadership in developing AI responsibly. Your [Responsible AI Standard / Constitutional AI approach / AI safety research] demonstrates a commitment to building systems that are not only powerful but trustworthy. As someone who has studied how legal frameworks can promote accountability without stifling innovation, I want to contribute to that mission from the policy and compliance side.

> I am particularly interested in your [Policy Team / Legal & Compliance function / Trust & Safety team], where my background in international law could support efforts to navigate the EU AI Act's requirements, engage with regulators across jurisdictions, and develop governance frameworks that scale globally.

---

## Variant B: Law Firm (Tech/AI Practice)

*For firms like Clifford Chance, Freshfields, White & Case, Hogan Lovells*

**Suggested customizations:**

> Having completed Clifford Chance's Antitrust Global Virtual Internship, I experienced firsthand how leading firms advise clients on complex regulatory matters. I am now seeking to deepen that experience in [Firm Name]'s [Technology / AI & Data / Dispute Resolution] practice, where I can apply my arbitration training to the emerging field of AI-related disputes.

> The 2025 White & Case International Arbitration Survey highlighted that AI is transforming how disputes are managed and resolved. With my LLM focus on International Commercial Arbitration and my research on AI governance, I am positioned to help clients navigate both the opportunities and risks that AI presents in cross-border disputes.

## Variant C: Think Tank / Research Institute

*For organizations like GovAI, Future of Privacy Forum, Berkman Klein Center, IAPS*

**Suggested customizations:**

> [Organization Name]'s research on AI governance addresses questions I find genuinely important: How do we ensure AI systems are accountable? How should international frameworks evolve to address AI's cross-border implications? My academic training in International and European Law, combined with my arbitration specialization, has equipped me to contribute rigorous legal analysis to these questions.

> I am particularly drawn to [specific research area or recent publication]. My multilingual research capabilities would allow me to incorporate perspectives from German, Spanish, and French legal scholarship that are often underrepresented in English-language policy discussions.

## Variant D: International Arbitration Institution

*For institutions like ICC, LCIA, SIAC, AAA-ICDR*

**Suggested customizations:**

> The [Institution]'s recent initiatives on AI in arbitration—[specific reference, e.g., the ICC Task Force / AAA-ICDR AI Arbitrator pilot]—represent exactly the kind of innovation I want to support. As arbitral institutions consider how AI can enhance efficiency while preserving due process, they need professionals who understand both the procedural requirements of international arbitration and the technical and ethical dimensions of AI systems.

> My LLM research focuses on comparative approaches to AI in arbitration across major institutions. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute this research to [Institution]'s ongoing work and help develop practical guidance for arbitrators, counsel, and parties navigating this evolving landscape.

# Key Talking Points

Use these in cover letters or interviews:

**On the EU AI Act:**
> "The EU AI Act's February 2025 prohibitions and August 2025 penalty regime create immediate compliance imperatives. My coursework on the Act, combined with my ability to research implementation across EU member states in their original languages, positions me to provide practical, jurisdiction-specific guidance."

**On AI in Arbitration:**
> "International arbitration is at an inflection point. The launch of AI-native arbitrators, AI-assisted document review, and predictive analytics tools raises fundamental questions about due process, transparency, and enforceability. My arbitration training gives me the procedural foundation to analyze these questions rigorously."

**On Multilingual Advantage:**
> "Legal analysis of AI regulation cannot rely solely on English-language sources. The German Bundestag, Spanish Cortes, and French Assemblée nationale are each shaping how the EU AI Act applies domestically. I can access these primary sources directly, providing analysis that captures nuances lost in translation."

**On Career Vision:**
> "I want to build a career at the intersection of international dispute resolution and AI governance. Whether advising companies on compliance, helping arbitral institutions adapt to technological change, or contributing to policy development, I see legal expertise as essential to ensuring AI benefits society broadly."
