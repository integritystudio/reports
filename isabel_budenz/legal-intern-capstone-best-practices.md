## 1. Best Practices for Intern Capstone Projects at Tech/AI Companies

### 1.1 Project Planning and Alignment

Effective capstone projects share several characteristics that maximize both learning outcomes and organizational value:

**Strategic Alignment**
- Align capstone projects with organizational Key Results (OKRs) to increase business relevance
- Connect project outcomes to strategic business priorities that executives genuinely value
- Balance personal interests with organizational needs for optimal engagement

**Clear Scope and Objectives**
- Identify a real-world challenge or business need
- Define scope, objectives, and success metrics upfront
- Write a formal project proposal and problem statement
- Establish measurable outcomes that demonstrate impact

**Timeline and Milestones**
- Typical capstone projects last 6-12 weeks depending on breadth and depth
- MIT Sloan's Analytics Capstone runs 7 months for comprehensive industry projects
- Structure projects with clear milestones and checkpoints
- Build in time for iteration and refinement

### 1.2 Demonstrating Business Impact

According to a [2025 NACE survey](https://www.nace.org/), nearly 90% of employers seek evidence that students can effectively solve problems. To demonstrate impact:

- **Quantify outcomes**: Show measurable results tied to business values
- **Establish baselines**: Compare performance against what would have occurred without the project
- **Document the "why"**: Focus on purpose and impact, not just deliverables
- **Create portfolio-ready artifacts**: Develop tangible examples to showcase in interviews

### 1.3 Industry Best Practices

Leading programs emphasize:

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Real-world application | Work on actual business problems, not hypothetical scenarios |
| Cross-functional collaboration | Engage with multiple teams and stakeholders |
| Mentor guidance | Receive support from experienced practitioners |
| Presentation and communication | Culminate in final presentations and deliverables |
| Portfolio building | Create artifacts that demonstrate job-readiness |
