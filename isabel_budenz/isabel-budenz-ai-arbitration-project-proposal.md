## Executive Summary

This project will produce a comprehensive comparative analysis of how AI is being adopted, regulated, and governed in international arbitration across major jurisdictions and arbitral institutions. The deliverables will provide actionable guidance for [Company Name]'s dispute resolution practice and position the organization as a thought leader in this rapidly evolving space.

---

## Problem Statement

The international arbitration landscape is undergoing significant transformation with the introduction of AI tools:

- **November 2025**: AAA-ICDR launched the first AI-native arbitrator for documents-only construction disputes
- **2025**: ICC Commission established a Task Force on AI in arbitration
- **Ongoing**: Major arbitral institutions (SIAC, LCIA, HKIAC, DIAC) are developing AI policies with varying approaches

However, there is **no comprehensive comparative framework** that:
1. Maps how different institutions are approaching AI adoption
2. Analyzes the ethical and procedural implications across jurisdictions
3. Provides practical guidance for practitioners navigating this evolving landscape

**Business Need**: [Company Name] requires clear guidance on AI use in arbitration proceedings to advise clients, manage risk, and identify opportunities for efficiency gains.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives

1. **Map the global landscape** of AI adoption in international arbitration across 8-10 major arbitral institutions
2. **Analyze regulatory and ethical frameworks** governing AI use in arbitration proceedings
3. **Identify best practices** for AI-assisted case management, document review, and decision support
4. **Develop practical guidance** for [Company Name]'s arbitration practice

### Secondary Objectives

5. **Assess risks and limitations** of current AI arbitration tools
6. **Compare jurisdictional approaches** to AI-generated evidence and AI-assisted awards
7. **Create internal training materials** for the dispute resolution team
