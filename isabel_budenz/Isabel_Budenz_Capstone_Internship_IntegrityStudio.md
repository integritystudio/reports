| Qualification | Application at IntegrityStudio |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| LLM International Commercial Arbitration (Stockholm) | Design dispute resolution clauses for AI service agreements |
| LLB International & European Law (Groningen) | Navigate EU AI Act compliance requirements |
| EU AI Act coursework | Immediate familiarity with regulatory framework |
| Quadrilingual (DE/ES/EN/FR) | Analyze regulations across key EU jurisdictions |
| Legal research for A for Arbitration | Academic rigor for policy documentation |
| Clifford Chance Antitrust Virtual Internship | Understanding of enterprise legal operations |
