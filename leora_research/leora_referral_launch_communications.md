### 2. Team Meeting Announcement Script

**Duration: 10 minutes**

"Good morning/afternoon everyone! I have some really exciting news to share today.

As you all know, one of our biggest challenges is finding caregivers who truly understand and embody our values. People who see our patients as family. People who bring that special combination of skill and heart that makes Leora different.

And here's what we realized: The people who understand that best are sitting in this room. **You** are our best ambassadors.

So today, we're launching our Employee Referral Program, and I want you to think of this as an opportunity to:
- Help shape our team's future
- Work alongside people you trust and respect
- Earn significant bonuses for bringing great people to Leora

**Here's how it works:** [Display slide or handout]

For every qualified caregiver you refer who gets hired, you can earn:
- $750 for CNAs
- $1,000 for LVNs
- $1,500 for RNs
- $2,000 for specialized positions

The bonuses are paid in three parts: when they're hired, after 90 days, and after 180 days. This ensures we're finding people who are here for the long term and truly fit our culture.

**And here's the best part:** There's no limit. If you refer 5 great CNAs this year, that's $3,750 in bonuses.

**Who should you refer?**

Think about:
- Former colleagues you loved working with
- Friends with healthcare experience
- Family members in the field
- Classmates from nursing school
- Anyone who has that special combination of empathy, reliability, and skill

Before you refer someone, ask yourself: 'Would I want to work side-by-side with this person? Would I trust them with my own family member?'

**How to submit:**
It's super easy. Just email referrals@leorahomehealth.com with:
- Your name
- Their name and contact info
- The position you think they'd be great for
- A few sentences about why they'd be a good fit

We've also created an online form if you prefer: leorahomehealth.com/referrals

**Current needs:**
Right now, we're especially looking for:
- CNAs for all shifts
- Weekend LVN
- Case manager RN

**Important notes:**
- The person you refer must mention your name in their application
- They go through our normal hiring process - referral doesn't guarantee a hire
- You need to have been here at least 60 days to participate
- Both you and the referral need to be in good standing for bonus payments

**Questions?**

[Take questions for 3-5 minutes]

I've got program guides for everyone to take with you. There's also a FAQ sheet that covers everything.

The bottom line is this: Help us find people who will love working here as much as you do. People who will care for our patients the way you do. And let us thank you financially for that help.

Who's ready to make their first referral?

Great! Let's build our dream team together. Thank you!"

## Manager Talking Points

**For team leaders to discuss with their teams:**

1. **Emphasize quality over quantity**: "One great referral is better than five mediocre ones"

2. **Personalize the impact**: "When you refer someone great, YOU benefit by working with them every day"

3. **Address concerns**: "No, you won't get in trouble if your referral doesn't work out - we appreciate you trying"

4. **Share the 'why'**: "Referred employees stay 88% longer than Indeed hires - that means less turnover stress for all of us"

5. **Make it conversational**: "Who's the best caregiver you've ever worked with? Are they available?"

6. **Celebrate publicly**: Recognize referrals in team meetings, even before they're hired

7. **Remove barriers**: "Don't overthink it - if you think they'd be good, submit them and let us evaluate"
