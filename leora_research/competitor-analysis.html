      <h4>Key Differentiator &mdash; Structured Referral Program</h4>
      <p>Leora's tiered employee referral program with milestone-based payouts (hire, 90-day, 180-day) is well-structured for retention. The $750-$2,000 referral bonus range is competitive in the Austin market and addresses the industry's #1 challenge: staffing. The 60-day employment eligibility requirement and good-standing criteria help ensure quality referrals.</p>

    <!-- Key Insights -->
    <h2>Key Competitive Insights</h2>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>1. Staffing Is the Strategic Battleground</h4>
      <p>In the Austin home health market, the primary competitive battle is not for patients &mdash; it's for staff. With 50+ agencies competing for the same CNA, LVN, and RN talent pool, and national RN vacancy rates at 15-20%, recruitment is the #1 constraint on growth. Leora's structured referral program is a strong retention tool, but competitors like MGA Homecare, TheKey, and hospital systems can often offer higher base pay, better benefits, and career advancement paths.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>2. Hospital System Pipeline Advantage</h4>
      <p>St. David's Healthcare at Home (part of HCA, the largest US hospital system) has a structural advantage: direct access to hospital discharge referrals. When patients leave St. David's hospitals, the default home health recommendation often goes to their own at-home division. Building relationships with independent physicians, clinics, and non-HCA hospitals (Seton/Ascension, Baylor Scott &amp; White) is essential for competing against this pipeline.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>3. PAS Program Niche</h4>
      <p>Leora's Personal Attendant Services (PAS) and HHA offerings position it in the Medicaid-funded attendant care segment, which has fewer competitors than the Medicare skilled nursing market. Outreach Health Services is the primary PAS competitor with 50+ years of experience. Specializing in PAS quality and reliability could differentiate Leora from agencies focused primarily on Medicare home health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>4. Online Presence Gap</h4>
      <p>Leora Home Health did not appear prominently in Caring.com's "10 Best Home Health Agencies in Austin" or Yelp's "Best 10 Home Health Care in Austin" listings. With 50+ agencies competing, online visibility directly drives patient and referral source decisions. Claiming and optimizing profiles on Caring.com, Google Business, Yelp, and AgingCare.com would improve competitive positioning at minimal cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>5. Market Sizing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>US home health market:</strong> $222.6B (2025); projected $692.3B by 2035</li>
        <li><strong>Market CAGR:</strong> 7.4% (2025-2032)</li>
        <li><strong>Americans receiving home health:</strong> 12 million annually</li>
        <li><strong>Patients 65+:</strong> 86% of home health recipients</li>
        <li><strong>US 65+ population:</strong> 61.2 million (2024), growing 3.1% annually</li>
        <li><strong>Austin metro agencies:</strong> 50+ (AgingCare.com count)</li>
