### Template 4: Cold Outreach Email (LinkedIn Connection Follow-Up)

**Subject:** AI Governance Question for [Organization Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Organization Name]'s recent [program/initiative/announcement] and was impressed by [specific detail that shows you did research].

I'm reaching out because I specialize in helping nonprofits like yours navigate AI adoption responsibly - specifically around governance, policy development, and strategic implementation.

Research shows that 85%+ of nonprofits are using AI tools, but 65-70% still don't have formal policies in place. This gap creates significant risk exposure, especially around:
• Donor data privacy
• Bias in service delivery
• Board oversight and accountability
• Grant compliance

**No sales pitch** - I'm genuinely curious: Is AI governance something on your radar at [Organization Name]?

If it's helpful, I'd be happy to share our AI Readiness Assessment (free, self-scoring tool) or our sample policy framework.

Either way, best of luck with [specific initiative they're working on]!

## LinkedIn Scripts

### Script 1: LinkedIn Connection Request (Personalized)

```
Hi [First Name],

I saw your recent post about [specific topic they posted about] and really appreciated your perspective on [specific point].

I work with nonprofits on responsible AI implementation and would love to connect and learn more about the work you're doing at [Organization].

Looking forward to connecting!

[Your Name]

### Script 2: LinkedIn Follow-Up Message (After Connection)

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting! I'm always interested to hear how nonprofit leaders are thinking about AI and technology.

Is AI adoption something that's on your radar at [Organization]? I've been researching this space and found that 75-80% of nonprofit leaders feel insufficiently prepared for AI, despite 85%+ already using it - and only 28% have provided formal staff training.

No sales pitch - I'm genuinely curious about your perspective!

Also, if it's helpful, I recently published a free AI Readiness Assessment specifically for nonprofits. Happy to share if you're interested.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Script 3: LinkedIn Post Template - Thought Leadership

```
85%+ of nonprofits are using AI.

But 65-70% don't have a formal AI policy.

This gap is a ticking time bomb.

Here's what I'm seeing:

→ Executive Directors using ChatGPT for donor communications
→ Development teams using AI for fundraising emails
→ Program staff experimenting with data analysis tools

All happening without:
❌ Board oversight
❌ Data privacy protocols
❌ Bias mitigation strategies
❌ Staff training

The result? Significant risk exposure.

But here's the good news:

Creating an AI policy doesn't have to take months or cost tens of thousands.

In my experience working with [X] nonprofits, the most successful AI policies have 8 essential elements:

1. [Element 1]
2. [Element 2]
3. [Element 3]
[... continue with valuable insights]

Your board will thank you for being proactive.

Need help getting started? I've created a free AI Policy Template specifically for nonprofits. Comment "POLICY" and I'll send it your way.

### Script 4: LinkedIn Post Template - Case Study

```
Last month, a nonprofit came to us with a problem:

Their grant reporting process was taking 40 hours per month.

Time their program director should have spent on mission delivery.

Here's what we did: 👇

[Image: Before/After Comparison]

THE CHALLENGE:
• Manual data collection from 5 different systems
• Copy-paste into funder-specific report templates
• Quality control and review process
• 40 hours/month of staff time

OUR APPROACH:
• 90-day AI pilot program
• Automated data aggregation
• AI-assisted report generation
• Human review and approval (maintained quality)

THE RESULTS:
✅ 75% reduction in reporting time (10 hours vs. 40)
✅ 30 hours/month freed up for program work
✅ Improved data accuracy (eliminated manual errors)
✅ Faster turnaround to funders

THE LESSON:

You don't need to automate everything.

Start with one painful, repetitive process.
Pilot it carefully.
Measure the impact.
Then scale.

This nonprofit is now exploring 3 more AI use cases based on this success.

Is grant reporting a bottleneck at your organization?

### Script 5: LinkedIn Comment Strategy (Engagement)

**When someone posts about AI challenges:**
```
Great post, [Name]! The data privacy concern you mentioned is #1 on every nonprofit leader's mind right now.

One framework that's worked well: Start with a clear data classification system (public, internal, sensitive, restricted) and define which AI tools can touch which categories.

70% of the policy battle is won when you have clear data governance.

Would you find it helpful if I shared our data classification template? Happy to send it your way.
```

**When someone announces a new role:**
```
Congratulations on the new role, [Name]! [Organization] is lucky to have you leading their technology strategy.

AI governance is going to be a big part of that CTO role over the next year - if you ever want to bounce ideas around or share war stories, I'm always happy to connect.

Best of luck! 🎉
