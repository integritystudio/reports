      <h4>Key Differentiator &mdash; Village Model</h4>
      <p>Capital City Village is the only Village Movement organization in Austin. The village model is unique in that it is member-driven, volunteer-powered, and community-based &mdash; a peer-support network rather than a service provider. Unlike for-profit home care agencies or government programs, CCV creates social connections and mutual aid among seniors, addressing the isolation that accelerates aging. With 300+ villages nationwide and growing, the model is proven but CCV is the sole Austin presence.</p>

    <!-- Key Insights -->
    <h2>Key Competitive Insights</h2>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>1. No Direct Village Model Competitor in Austin</h4>
      <p>Capital City Village is the only Village Movement organization serving the Austin metro area. With 300+ villages nationwide, the model is well-established, but CCV has no peer-model competitor locally. The closest alternatives are either government-funded resource centers (ADRC), advocacy organizations (AustinUP), or for-profit care providers &mdash; none of which offer the peer-support, volunteer-driven community model that defines the village approach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>2. Website Is the #1 Competitive Liability</h4>
      <p>The analysis report identified critical website issues: broken images on the homepage, dead links, mixed URL patterns (capitalcityvillage.org vs. helpfulvillage.com), and poor mobile responsiveness. In a market where seniors and their adult children increasingly search online for services, this creates a significant credibility gap. The recommended hybrid approach (modern marketing site + Helpful Village backend) would address this at $500-$1,500/year.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>3. "Village" Brand Confusion</h4>
      <p>Two for-profit senior living facilities in Austin use "Village" in their names &mdash; Village on the Park (Onion Creek) and The Village at The Triangle. This creates search confusion and may dilute CCV's brand. Optimizing for specific search terms like "aging in place Austin," "senior volunteer services Austin," and "village movement Austin" would help differentiate from facility-based competitors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>4. Referral Partnership Ecosystem</h4>
      <p>Several organizations in the Austin senior services landscape are natural referral partners rather than competitors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aging Services Council:</strong> Coordination body that can direct seniors to CCV</li>
        <li><strong>ADRC/CAPCOG:</strong> Government resource center that can refer lower-need seniors</li>
        <li><strong>Meals on Wheels:</strong> Daily contact with isolated seniors who may benefit from CCV's social programs</li>
        <li><strong>Home care agencies:</strong> CCV members who need professional care can be referred out</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Building formal referral relationships with these organizations would expand CCV's reach without increasing competition.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>5. Payment Processing Savings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stripe nonprofit discount:</strong> Save 0.7% per transaction (apply this week, no cost)</li>
        <li><strong>Zeffy for events:</strong> 0% fees on event tickets</li>
        <li><strong>PayPal Giving Fund:</strong> Already in use, 0% fees</li>
        <li><strong>Projected savings:</strong> $1,000-$1,500/year on $50,000 transaction volume</li>
      </ul>
