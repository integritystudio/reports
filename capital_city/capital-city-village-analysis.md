## Board Decision Summary

### The Bottom Line

CCV's current website has critical issues (broken images, dead links) that create an unprofessional first impression. Additionally, CCV could save **$1,000-1,500 annually** by optimizing payment processing.

### Decisions Needed

#### Decision 1: Website Strategy

| Option | Cost | Effort | Recommendation |
|--------|------|--------|----------------|

| **C. Full WordPress Migration** | $3,000-5,000/yr | High | Only if growth demands it |

**Staff Recommendation:** Option B (Hybrid) - Keep Helpful Village for member operations, build modern marketing site on Squarespace/WordPress.

#### Decision 2: Payment Processing

| Action | Impact | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Apply for Stripe Nonprofit discount | Save 0.7% per transaction | This week |
| Add Zeffy for events | 0% fees on event tickets | Before next event |
| Keep PayPal Giving Fund | Already working, 0% fees | Ongoing |

**Projected Annual Savings:** $1,000-1,500 on $50,000 transaction volume

This analysis covers two main areas:

2. **Payment Processors Analysis** - Comparison of options suitable for CCV's needs

---

## Part 1: Website Redesign Analysis

### Current State Assessment

#### Platform
CCV currently uses **Helpful Village** (helpfulvillage.com), a specialized SaaS platform built specifically for Village Movement organizations. The website is hosted at capitalcityvillage.org but the backend runs on capitalcity.helpfulvillage.com.

#### Design/UX Evaluation

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Visual Design | Poor | Outdated appearance; multiple broken image links observed on homepage |
| Navigation | Fair | Basic menu structure exists but inconsistent URL patterns |
| Mobile Responsiveness | Unknown | Could not fully evaluate; platform claims mobile support |
| Content Organization | Fair | Information is present but scattered across multiple page types |
| Accessibility | Unknown | No evidence of WCAG compliance testing |
| Brand Consistency | Poor | Mix of capitalcityvillage.org and helpfulvillage.com URLs creates confusion |

#### Critical Issues Identified (With Evidence)

1. **Broken Images on Homepage**
   - Multiple images failing to load from helpfulvillage.com/documents/ URLs
   - Creates unprofessional appearance and poor first impression
   - Carousel/slideshow showing "Image not found" errors

   **Evidence Observed:**
   - Homepage carousel: 3 of 5 slides display "Image not found" placeholder
   - Member spotlight section: Profile photos returning 404 errors
   - Event banners: Links to helpfulvillage.com/documents/[id] broken

2. **Inconsistent URL Structure**
   - Some pages at www.capitalcityvillage.org
   - Others redirect to capitalcity.helpfulvillage.com
   - Some pages return 403 (Forbidden) or 404 (Not Found) errors

   - Events page: redirects to capitalcity.helpfulvillage.com/events (403 Forbidden)
   - Support page: capitalcityvillage.org/support (404 Not Found)
   - About Us: links to /sponsors instead of /about

3. **Limited Customization**
   - Website appears templated with limited branding options
   - Design reflects platform defaults rather than CCV's identity

4. **Navigation Confusion**
   - "Support" page returned 404 error
   - "About Us" link led to "Sponsors" page instead
   - Events calendar inaccessible (403 error)

#### Strengths

- Clear mission statement on homepage
- Detailed membership information and pricing tiers
- Staff/Board pages with photos and bios create personal connection
- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion statement prominently displayed
- GuideStar Silver Transparency badge displayed
- Title VI compliance notice present

### Redesign Recommendations

**Implementation:**
1. New public-facing website for marketing, donations, events calendar

The Village Movement has grown to 350+ villages nationwide since Beacon Hill Village pioneered the model in 2002. Many established Villages have evolved their web presence:

*Note: Website strategies vary by Village size, budget, and technical capacity. CCV should consider contacting peer Villages directly for implementation insights.*

**Village to Village Network Resources:**

5. **Forms:** Single-column layouts, clear labels, helpful error messages
6. **Content:** Short paragraphs, bullet points, scannable headings
7. **Media:** Compress images for fast loading, always include alt text

### Payment Processor Comparison

**Zeffy Details:**

- Integrated CRM and donor management

**PayPal Giving Fund Details:**
- 100% of donation goes to charity

- Drawback: 15-45 day payout delay
- CCV already uses this option

#### Tier 2: Low-Fee Nonprofit-Focused Platforms

| Processor | Transaction Fee | Monthly Fee | ACH Fee | Key Features |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Stripe (Nonprofit)** | 2.2% + $0.30 | $0 | 0.8% + $0.30 | Global, 100+ payment methods |
| **Bloomerang Payments** | 2.2% + $0.30 + 1% platform | $0 | 0.8% + $0.30 | CRM integration, fraud protection |

| **PayPal Standard** | 1.99% + $0.49 | $0 | Yes | High donor recognition/trust |

| **Authorize.Net** | 2.9% + $0.30 | $25 | No | Strong security features |
| **Clover** | 2.3% + $0.10 | Varies | No | POS hardware options |

### Detailed Recommendations

#### Primary Recommendation: Stripe for Nonprofits

**Why Stripe:**
- Industry-standard reliability and security
- Nonprofit discount: 2.2% + $0.30 (vs standard 2.9% + $0.30)
- Lower ACH fees for larger donations (0.8%)
- Integrates with virtually any website or platform
- Instant payouts available if needed
- Supports recurring donations natively
- Global payment methods (for snowbird members)

**Requirements to Apply:**
- 501(c)(3) documentation (CCV has this - GuideStar verified)
- 80%+ of volume must be tax-deductible donations
- Email nonprofit@stripe.com with EIN and verification

**Note:** Membership dues may not qualify for nonprofit discount since they're not technically donations. CCV should verify with Stripe.

**How to Apply:**
- Email: nonprofit@stripe.com
- Include: 501(c)(3) determination letter, EIN, brief description of CCV
- Typical response time: 5-7 business days

#### Secondary Recommendation: Zeffy (For Maximum Donation Retention)

**Why Zeffy:**
- Zero transaction fees means 100% of donations reach CCV
- Particularly valuable for small-dollar recurring gifts
- Free event ticketing (golf tournament, luncheons)
- No monthly minimums or hidden fees
- Donor covers optional tip to Zeffy (not to CCV)

**Considerations:**
- Newer platform, less established than Stripe/PayPal
- Relies on donor tips to sustain business model
- May have fewer integration options

**How to Get Started:**
- Website: zeffy.com/nonprofits
- Sign-up: Free, instant approval for 501(c)(3) organizations
- Support: help@zeffy.com

#### Keep: PayPal Giving Fund

**Why Continue Using:**
- Already established
- Zero fees
- Integrates with social media fundraising
- Familiar to many donors

**Improvements:**
- Promote more prominently on website
- Use for one-time donations where delayed payout is acceptable
- Not ideal for membership dues (delayed access to funds)

### Fee Impact Analysis

**Scenario:** CCV processes $50,000 annually in donations/memberships

| Processor | Effective Fee Rate | Annual Cost | Net to CCV |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Zeffy | 0% | $0 | $50,000 |
| PayPal Giving Fund | 0% | $0 | $50,000 |
| Stripe Nonprofit | ~2.5% | $1,250 | $48,750 |
| Bloomerang | ~3.5% | $1,750 | $48,250 |
| PayPal Standard | ~2.5% | $1,250 | $48,750 |
| Square | ~3.2% | $1,600 | $48,400 |

**Note:** Donor-covered fees can offset these costs. Many platforms report 70-85% of donors opt to cover fees when asked.

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Immediate (0-30 days)
1. Fix broken images on current website (contact Helpful Village)
2. Continue using PayPal Giving Fund for donations
3. Apply for Stripe nonprofit discount

#### Phase 2: Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Implement Stripe for membership dues (recurring billing)
2. Evaluate Zeffy for event registration/ticketing
3. Add "cover processing fees" option to all donation forms

#### Phase 3: Medium-term (3-6 months)
1. If pursuing website redesign, integrate payment processor with new site
2. Consolidate payment reporting for better financial tracking
3. Implement donor acknowledgment automation
