## Executive Summary

Sound Sight Tarot is a psychology-infused tarot reading business in Austin, TX, founded in 2017 by Carly Fischer, a former Facebook/Meta employee. The company offers individual tarot sessions ($105-$111), structured classes ($99-$199), and corporate/private events for groups of 3 to 100+ guests. Notably, Sound Sight Tarot has built an impressive corporate client roster including Google, Meta, Netflix, Bumble, Pinterest, Lululemon, and Tom Ford. The business holds perfect 5-star ratings across Yelp (11 reviews), Google, and Thumbtack, and Carly has been nominated as Austin's Best Tarot Reader by the Austin Chronicle every year since 2017. Operating within the $2.3 billion U.S. psychic services industry (growing at 5.5% CAGR), Sound Sight Tarot is well-positioned in Austin's young, affluent, event-driven market -- a metro of 2.6 million residents with a median age of 34.5 and 40.2 million annual downtown visitors. The company's psychology-forward, secular approach and established corporate event pipeline differentiate it from traditional tarot practitioners in an increasingly mainstream wellness category.
